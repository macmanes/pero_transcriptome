\section*{Introduction}

For biologists interested in understanding the relationship between fitness, genotype, and phenotype, modern sequencing technologies provide for an unprecedented opportunity to gain a deep understanding of genome level processes that together, underlie adaptation.  One interesting example of adaptation lies in animals ability to survive desert conditions. Here, heat \emph{and} drought provide for powerful selective forces, testing animals' ability to osmoregulate and thus to survive. \\

Specifically, the maintenance of water balance in animals is one of the most important physiologic processes, and is critical to desert survival. Indeed, mammals are exquisitely sensitive to changes in osmolality, with slight derangement eliciting physiologic compromise.  When the loss of water exceeds dietary intake, dehydration - and in extreme cases, death - can occur.  Unlike most mammals, animals living in desert habitats are subjected to long periods of extreme heat and intense drought.  As a result, desert animals have evolved mechanisms through which physiologic homeostasis is maintained despite severe and prolonged dehydration. While the elucidation of these mechanisms is beyond the scope of this manuscript, we aim here to lay the groundwork by characterizing the transcriptome from four distinct tissues (brain, liver, kidney, testes). Further, via sequencing the renal tissue of a total of 15 additional animals, we characterize nucleotide polymorphism and genome wide patterns of natural selection.

\subsection*{RNA extraction and Sequencing}

Total RNA was extracted from each tissue using a TRIzol extraction (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers instructions. Because preparation of an RNA
library suitable for sequencing is dependent on having high
quality, intact RNA, a small aliquot of each total RNA extract was
analyzed on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
Following confirmation of sample quality, the reference sequencing libraries
were made using the TruSeq stranded RNA prep kit
(Illumina), while an unstranded TruSeq kit was used to construct the other sequencing libraries. A unique index was ligated to each sample to allow for multiplexed
sequencing. Reference libraries (n=4 tissue types) were then pooled to
contain equimolar quantities of each individual library and
submitted for Illumina sequencing using two lanes of 150nt paired end sequencing using the rapid-mode of the HiSeq 2500 sequencer at The Hubbard Center for Genome Sciences (University of New Hampshire). The remaining 14 libraries were similarly multiplexed and sequenced in a mixture of 100nt paired and single end across two lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 2000 at the Vincent G. Coates Gnome Center (University of California, Berkeley).

\subsection*{Sequence Data Preprocessing and Assembly}

Following recommendations from MacManes \citep{MacManes:2014io} and Mbandi \citep{Christoffels:2014bg}, adapter sequence contamination was removed, and low quality nucleotides (defined as \textsc{Phred} \textless 2) were removed from the dataset using the program Trimmomatic version 0.32  \citep{Lohse:2012fg}. We concatenated sequence data from each reference tissue type and assembled them using the Trinity beta version released 16 March 2014 \citep{Haas:2013jq}. We used flags indicating the stranded nature of sequencing reads and set maximum physical distance between read pairs to 999nt. To filter the raw sequence assembly, I estimated TPM for each assembled sequence using bwa-mem \citep{Li:2013wn} and eXpress \citep{Roberts:2012dh}, removing all contigs whose expression was less than TPM=1 \citep{Haas:2013jq}.
